	The excellent CN235 is the lowest cost solution to meet the needs and requirements of governments and air forces, as well as non-governmental organisations in the light and medium airlift field. Able to carry up to six tonnes / 13,200lb of payload, or up to 51 personnel, 
	the CN235 has gained vast experience in daily airlift missions, in the deployment and logistic support of peacekeeping forces and in disaster relief operations or any other ‘civic’ missions for the benefit of society. In addition, and thanks to its versatility and multi-mission 
	capabilities, it is also widely used for maritime surveillance and homeland security applications.

	<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="5"> <b><i>
	The CN235 is able to cruise at altitudes up to 25,000ft, and speeds up to 245kt / 454 km/h, while retaining remarkable low level flight characteristics, as well as short take-off 
	and landing (STOL) capabilities. Powered by two General Electric GE CT7-9CE, 1,750 shp turboprop engines, the CN235 provides excellent manoeuvrability, fast engine response, outstanding hot and high performance, low fuel consumption and consequently a very long endurance of up to 11 hours. 
	The current CN235 model in production (CN235-300) was certified in 1998 It benefits from simple systems design and robustness, excellent flying qualities, and great versatility, as well as remarkable transport capabilities. All this makes it a true and highly efficient “workhorse”, 
	with the lowest fuel burn, and the best operating and maintenance costs in its category.

	<p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="5"> <b><i>
	The civil and military certification of the CN235 ensures compliance with the international airworthiness regulations and safety standards, including the stringent requirements of the US FAA and the European EASA. 
	The CN235’s reliability and dependability has also been widely demonstrated. In service with some 40 operators worldwide, the aircraft has accumulated over one million flight hours. And with more than 270 sold , the CN235 is the best selling airlifter in the light/medium segment.
